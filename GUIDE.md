# 🌟 Nine Months: Constellation Guide (Orion Edition)

Hey Sarib! The stars are now brighter, the constellation is more defined, and navigation is smoother.

## 🚀 Key Improvements
- **Constellation Path**: Our stars now form a structured constellation inspired by Orion. Month 1-9 form a central figure, and additional months extend in a graceful cosmic arc.
- **Vibrant Visibility**: Constellation stars are now significantly brighter than background stars, featuring heavy light emission and distinct "Month X" labels.
- **Fixed Navigation**: Adding a new month now correctly updates the constellation and centers the camera on the newest star instantly.
- **Refined Interaction**: Side arrows are larger and more responsive, perfect for your tablet.

## 📱 Navigation 101
- **Focus Stars**: Tap the **Large Glowing Arrows** on the sides to fly between months.
- **View Memories**: Once a star is in the center, tap it to open the minimalist memory gallery.
- **Reset View**: Double tap any dark space to pull back and see the entire constellation figure.

## ✨ Adding New Stars
Use the **(+) Catch** icon:
- Entering a new month number (e.g., Month 10) creates a new point in the sky.
- The golden line connects the new star automatically.
- The camera flies to the new discovery immediately.

## ☁️ Persistent Storage
Everything is saved to your tablet's local browser memory.
